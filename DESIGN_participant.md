# Taglow Survey Participant Design System

This document is the design contract for the Taglow Survey participant SPA and participant preview surfaces. In this admin repository, the production admin UI still follows `DESIGN.md`; only participant-facing preview regions should follow this document unless a task explicitly changes the public participant app too.

The participant product is a focused survey flow for students and respondents who enter through a public link or QR, authenticate with Google, answer section by section, recover local drafts, tag locations on images, review, and submit. The UI should feel like a calm product experience, not an admin form.

## 1. Product Experience

### Primary Impression

"I can finish this without effort, and my answer will be handled carefully."

### Experience Goals

- Keep the respondent oriented: where they are, what is required, what happens next.
- Reduce survey fatigue by showing one focused step at a time.
- Make structured answers feel lightweight, not bureaucratic.
- Preserve trust through clear auth, draft recovery, validation, and submission states.
- Keep bilingual rendering predictable across Korean and English.
- Make image/floorplan location feedback easy enough to use on a phone.

### What Taglow Is Not

- Not a marketing landing page.
- Not an admin dashboard.
- Not a decorative brand showcase.
- Not a long single-page institutional form.
- Not a UI that relies on labels or colors that cannot be stored analytically.

## 2. Visual Direction

Taglow is inspired by Toss: white canvas, warm charcoal text, optimistic blue interaction, and plain language. The implementation is intentionally restrained.

Use:

- White or near-white page backgrounds.
- Border-first surfaces.
- Blue for primary actions, selected states, progress, and helpful information.
- Warm neutral text hierarchy.
- Large mobile tap targets.
- Compact but breathable question surfaces.
- Bottom sticky actions when they reduce effort.

Avoid:

- Decorative gradients, blobs, bokeh, heavy hero treatment, or generic illustration filler.
- Dense admin tables or dashboard composition.
- Excess shadows.
- Red as decorative emphasis.
- Placeholder-only labeling.
- Showing every survey question at once.
- Nested card-on-card layouts.

## 3. Runtime Token Source

The participant design tokens are represented as scoped CSS variables in preview surfaces so the admin design system remains unchanged. If the public participant app becomes a separate runtime, move these tokens into its runtime token file and keep this document synchronized.

### Color Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--color-brand-700` | `#1b64da` | Pressed primary, eyebrow text, selected text |
| `--color-brand-600` | `#3182f6` | Primary CTA, progress, selected borders, focus |
| `--color-brand-500` | `#4f96ff` | Soft hover or emphasis when needed |
| `--color-brand-100` | `#eaf3ff` | Selected backgrounds, info borders |
| `--color-brand-50` | `#f4f9ff` | Info panels, draft restore tint |
| `--color-bg` | `#ffffff` | App canvas, sticky header background |
| `--color-bg-subtle` | `#f7f9fc` | Low-emphasis panels, grouped scale panel |
| `--color-surface` | `#ffffff` | Cards, inputs, choice controls |
| `--color-surface-subtle` | `#f2f5f9` | Progress track, neutral input surfaces, summary tiles |
| `--color-text` | `#191f28` | Primary text |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#6b7684` | Descriptions, helper text |
| `--color-text-subtle` | `#8b95a1` | Secondary helper, disabled text |
| `--color-border` | `#e5e8eb` | Default border |
| `--color-border-strong` | `#d1d6db` | Drag-ready or focusable neutral border |
| `--color-success` | `#00a86b` | Completion and success eyebrow |
| `--color-success-bg` | `#e8f8f1` | Success message background |
| `--color-warning` | `#f59f00` | Warning state |
| `--color-warning-bg` | `#fff5db` | Warning message background |
| `--color-danger` | `#e03131` | Blocking error text and danger action |
| `--color-danger-bg` | `#fff0f0` | Error or danger background |

Color rules:

- A normal viewport should have at most two saturated blue elements.
- Blue means action, selected state, information, or progress.
- Neutral surfaces use border and spacing before shadow.
- Error states must include text, not red alone.
- Do not store translated labels as values; UI color must not imply data shape.

Approved current non-token effects:

- Sticky bottom action background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.96)`.
- Dialog backdrop: `rgba(25, 31, 40, 0.36)`.
- Sticker/image pin drop-shadow: `rgba(25, 31, 40, 0.18)`.
- Tokenize these before introducing additional similar effects.

### Typography Tokens

Use the Korean-first system stack:

```css
font-family: Pretendard, Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
```

| Token | Size | Line | Weight | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--font-size-display` | `28px` | `36px` | `700` | Intro, review, complete, login/system page titles |
| `--font-size-title` | `22px` | `30px` | `700` | Section title in `StepHeader` |
| `--font-size-heading` | `18px` | `26px` | `700` | Question title, card headings, dialog title |
| `--font-size-body` | `16px` | `24px` | `400` | Main copy, option labels, buttons |
| `--font-size-small` | `14px` | `20px` | `400` | Helper text, errors, descriptions |
| `--font-size-caption` | `12px` | `16px` | `500` | Eyebrows, counters, rank labels, progress meta |

Typography rules:

- Letter spacing is always `0`.
- Do not scale font size with viewport width.
- Body copy is regular by default.
- Use bold for actions, selected options, section numbers, and headings.
- Numeric emphasis belongs to progress, review counts, scores, and section numbering.

### Spacing Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--space-1` | `4px` | Tiny label/helper gaps |
| `--space-2` | `8px` | Option gaps, control inner groups |
| `--space-3` | `12px` | Choice row gap, bottom nav gap |
| `--space-4` | `16px` | Default component padding, sticky bottom padding |
| `--space-5` | `20px` | Mobile page side padding, question shell padding |
| `--space-6` | `24px` | Section separation |
| `--space-8` | `32px` | Page top padding, broad separation |
| `--space-10` | `40px` | Entry page top padding, bottom scroll buffer |
| `--space-12` | `48px` | Login/system/complete top padding |

Spacing rules:

- Mobile page horizontal padding is normally `--space-5`.
- Question shells use `--space-5` padding and `--space-4` internal gap.
- Question lists use `--space-5` vertical gap.
- Bottom sticky actions use `--space-4` plus safe-area inset.
- Never compress touch controls below 44px high.

### Radius Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--radius-sm` | `8px` | Small affordances, accordion toggle |
| `--radius-md` | `12px` | Buttons, inputs, choices |
| `--radius-lg` | `16px` | Question shells, cards, review tiles |
| `--radius-xl` | `20px` | Draft restore banner, bottom sheets |
| `--radius-pill` | `999px` | Progress track, badges, segmented controls |

Radius rules:

- Default controls use `--radius-md`.
- Question and card surfaces should stay at `--radius-lg` or less.
- Use pill radius only for progress bars, small badges, and segmented controls.

### Elevation Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--shadow-none` | `none` | Default surfaces |
| `--shadow-soft` | `0 8px 24px rgba(25, 31, 40, 0.08)` | Sticky bottom bars, selected locale control, focus combination |
| `--shadow-floating` | `0 16px 40px rgba(25, 31, 40, 0.12)` | Image tag editor dialog |

Elevation rules:

- Use borders first.
- Shadows are rare and should suggest floating or persistence.
- Do not use colored shadows.

### Layout Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--layout-mobile-max` | `480px` | Login/system/complete narrow pages |
| `--layout-content-max` | `720px` | Entry, intro, section pages |
| `--layout-review-max` | `840px` | Review page |
| `--layout-bottom-action-height` | `80px` | Scroll padding above sticky actions |

### Motion Tokens

| Token | Value | Current Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--motion-fast` | `120ms` | Button/choice feedback |
| `--motion-base` | `180ms` | Progress width and ordinary state changes |
| `--motion-slow` | `240ms` | Reserved for slightly larger transitions |
| `--ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | Default ease |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)` | Exit/settle ease when needed |
| `--focus-ring` | `0 0 0 3px rgba(49, 130, 246, 0.24)` | Focus-visible box shadow |

Reduced motion:

- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` sets motion tokens to `0ms`.
- The image tag sticker hint must stop animating and remain visible at the image target position.

## 4. Global CSS Rules

- Use `box-sizing: border-box` globally.
- `html` and `body` use white background and the participant base font family.
- `button`, `input`, `textarea`, and `select` inherit font.
- Links inherit color.
- `:focus-visible` uses a brand outline with offset.
- `::selection` uses `--color-brand-100`.

## 5. Page Layout Patterns

### Login And System State

Login, access denied, already submitted, closed, not found, and complete-like states use a narrow `--layout-mobile-max` column.

- Page padding: `--space-12 --space-5`.
- Content is a grid with `--space-5` gap.
- Eyebrow uses brand or success color, caption size, bold weight.
- Body text is muted.

### Intro

The intro page sets expectations and gives the user a clean start.

- Use `--layout-content-max`.
- Header has eyebrow, display title, optional description.
- Information cards use border, `--radius-lg`, `--space-5`.
- Section list links are 52px high rows with subtle background and numbered pill.
- Locale control is segmented: subtle container, white selected segment, soft shadow.
- Bottom CTA is fixed and full width within content max.

### Section Answering

The section page is a viewport-height task surface.

- Use `height: 100vh` plus `100dvh`.
- Header is sticky at top with white background.
- Body scrolls independently and reserves bottom padding for fixed actions.
- Questions are not all shown if an image tag question is active; image tag questions become their own screen.
- Non-image questions in the same section can appear together in one screen.
- Bottom navigation is fixed with secondary "previous" and primary "next/review" actions.

### Review

The review page is denser but still participant-focused.

- Use `--layout-review-max`.
- Show warning/success message first.
- Summary uses three neutral tiles: sections, answers, location marks.
- Section rows show completion or missing required counts plus action.
- Submit CTA is fixed at bottom and disabled until required answers are complete.

### Complete

The complete page confirms submission and explains use of the response.

- Narrow `--layout-mobile-max`.
- Success eyebrow.
- One clear title.
- One muted explanation.
- Success message and secondary return action.

## 6. Shared Components

### Button

- Base height: 48px minimum.
- Shape: `--radius-md`.
- Padding: `0 --space-5`.
- Font: body size, bold.
- Active state moves down 1px.
- Disabled state uses `opacity: 0.56` and `not-allowed`.
- Variants:
  - `primary`: brand-600 background, white text, brand-700 hover.
  - `secondary`: white surface, border, text color.
  - `tertiary`: transparent, brand-700 text.
  - `danger`: danger background and danger text.
- One primary button per major decision surface.
- Use full-width buttons for bottom CTAs and narrow mobile pages.

### Message

- Role is `alert` for error, `status` otherwise.
- Shape: `--radius-lg`.
- Padding: `--space-4`.
- Title is body size.
- Content is small muted text.
- Tone backgrounds:
  - Info: brand-50 with brand-100 border.
  - Success: success-bg.
  - Warning: warning-bg.
  - Error: danger-bg.

### ProgressBar

- Track height: 8px.
- Track and bar use pill radius.
- Bar uses brand-600 and animates width with `--motion-base`.
- Meta line is caption size, medium weight, muted.
- Always show a percent, plus a contextual label when available.

### Select

- Always render a visible label.
- Control height: 48px minimum.
- Shape: `--radius-md`.
- Focus uses brand border plus focus ring.
- Placeholder option is "선택해주세요".
- Helper and error use caption size.

## 7. Question Surface

### QuestionShell

Most individual questions render inside `QuestionShell`.

- Surface: white, border, `--radius-lg`, `--space-5`.
- Header gap: `--space-2`.
- Question title: heading size, bold.
- Question number is brand colored and separated from title text.
- Required questions append a visual `*` with accessible label "필수".
- Description is small muted text.
- Error is small danger text after children.

### Required Validation

- Missing required questions show "필수 문항입니다." near the affected shell/group.
- Section-level blocking message says "필수 문항을 먼저 답해주세요."
- Do not advance until current screen required answers are complete.

## 8. Question Type Patterns

### Scale

Scale questions are fixed 1 to 5.

- Keep five equal square buttons.
- Labels: "1 매우 낮음" and "5 매우 높음".
- Selected button uses brand-600 background and white text.
- Low score follow-up appears when score is at or below `config.lowScoreThreshold`, default `2`.

### Single Choice

Single choice is a radio UI, not a generic button list.

- Use `role="radiogroup"`.
- Each option is a label with a native `input type="radio"`.
- Minimum row height is 48px.
- Radio size is 20px and uses brand accent color.
- Selected state uses brand-100 background, brand border, brand-700 text, bold weight.

### Multi Select

Multi select is a checkbox UI.

- Each option is a label with a native `input type="checkbox"`.
- Show selected count guidance.
- Enforce max selection by disabling additional options.
- Disabled options use subtle surface and subtle text.
- Selecting `other` reveals a short text input labeled "기타 내용".
- Store selected option values, not labels.

### Text

Text questions support three current modes.

- Plain text: no category selector, no visible "의견 내용" label, no placeholder-only guidance.
- Short text: `questionType: "text"` with `config.textMode: "short"` or `config.multiline: false` renders a 48px text input.
- Long text: default renders textarea with 120px minimum height.
- Selection-after-category text: when configured with opinion options or `textMode: "select_text"`, show opinion radio choices first, then text input/textarea.
- Respect `validation.maxLength` or `config.maxLength`.

### Ranking

Ranking is tap-to-rank.

- Do not require drag as the only interaction.
- Each option is a 52px row.
- Left column shows `-` or `n순위`.
- Selecting an unranked option appends the next rank up to max.
- Selecting a ranked option removes it and reflows ranks.

### Image/Floorplan Tagging

Participant-facing copy must never say "image tagging". Use location selection language.

- Pin touch target remains 44px by 44px.
- Existing pins render from ratios so they survive responsive image resizing.
- The canvas drag-ready state uses neutral strong border, not red.
- Required reason error says "이유를 짧게 적어주세요."

Participant uploaded image tagging:

- Upload button is a styled label with invisible file input.
- Only images are accepted.
- Invalid mime/size errors explain the next step.
- Re-upload resets existing points.

## 9. Draft, Recovery, And Submission UX

Drafts are client-side only.

- Autosave delay: 6500ms.
- Save again on visibility hidden and before unload.
- Restore prompt appears on intro and section pages when a compatible draft exists.
- Draft restore banner uses brand-50/brand-100 tint and `--radius-xl`.
- Banner actions are "처음부터" and "이어서 작성".
- Submit success removes draft.
- Submit failure preserves current answers and shows a corrective error message.

## 10. Copy And Tone

Taglow uses plain, polite language. It should sound like a helpful product, not an institution.

Voice:

- Short sentences.
- Concrete next actions.
- Calm reassurance for auth, draft, validation, and submit errors.
- No hype.
- No jokes in blocking states.
- No technical terms in participant-facing copy.
- Korean copy may use polite `-해주세요` and `-됩니다`.
- English copy should be concise and direct.

Preferred Korean patterns:

- "이전에 작성하던 응답이 있습니다."
- "필수 문항을 먼저 답해주세요."
- "응답이 제출되었습니다."
- "네트워크 상태를 확인한 뒤 다시 시도해주세요."
- "작성 중인 응답은 유지됩니다."

Avoid:

- "오류가 발생했습니다" without cause or next action.
- "이미지 태깅을 수행하세요."
- "payload", "cache", "schema", "validation".
- Labels that describe implementation instead of participant action.
- Long explanatory paragraphs inside question surfaces.

## 11. Bilingual And Data Rules

- Render localized display text from survey title, description, section title, question title, and option labels.
- Fall back to the survey default locale when translation is missing.
- Store analytics-friendly values only: option values, score values, topic keys, space keys, image ratios, tag types.
- Do not store translated labels as answer values.
- Keep Korean and English copy aligned in function, not necessarily word-for-word.

## 12. Accessibility Rules

- Minimum interactive target is 44px.
- Native radio and checkbox controls are preferred for single and multi select.
- Interactive labels must include real inputs when the control represents a form state.
- Use `aria-labelledby` for question inputs tied to question titles.
- Use `aria-invalid` for invalid selects.
- Error messages should identify what to fix.
- Do not rely on color alone.
- Focus-visible styles are required and must be visible on keyboard navigation.
- Dialogs use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- Image pins must be keyboard reachable and editable.
- Motion must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 13. Responsive Rules

- Design mobile first.
- Keep main survey content inside `--layout-content-max`.
- Keep system/login/complete pages inside `--layout-mobile-max`.
- Keep review inside `--layout-review-max`.
- Use `100dvh` where viewport-height section behavior matters.
- Sticky bottom bars must account for `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
- Avoid layout shifts from dynamic labels, counters, selected states, and validation messages.
- For fixed-format controls, define stable dimensions: square scale buttons, 48px choice rows, 52px ranking rows, 44px pins, 52px drag source.

## 14. Motion Rules

Motion should clarify state, not entertain.

Allowed:

- Button active press: `translateY(1px)`.
- Progress width transition.
- Choice selected state transition.
- Image tag hint from original sticker position to image target before the first tag.
- Drag preview following pointer.

Avoid:

- Page-level decorative animation.
- Bounce, spring overshoot, or playful motion.
- Infinite motion outside the pre-first-tag hint.
- Motion that competes with form completion.

## 15. Visual QA Checklist

Before shipping UI changes:

- Text does not overlap at mobile widths.
- Sticky bottom actions do not cover the active question.
- Required errors are visible without color-only communication.
- Question groups preserve per-question answer data.
- Image tag stickers are 25px visible but keep accessible touch targets.
- First-tag hint disappears once a tag is being dragged, edited, or saved.
- Locale changes do not break labels or control widths.
- Build and targeted component tests pass.

## 16. Implementation Rules

- Component CSS owns only component internals.
- Page CSS owns page shell, sticky actions, and high-level layout.
- Use component-prefixed class names.
- Prefer existing primitives: `Button`, `Message`, `ProgressBar`, `Select`, `StepHeader`, `QuestionShell`.
- Use design tokens instead of literal colors, spacing, radius, typography, or motion.
- If a new visual primitive needs a value not covered by tokens, add the token first.
- Do not import Supabase SDK or raw gateway types into views.
- Keep answer values compatible with the participant API boundary.
- Add or update tests when changing question behavior, validation, or grouping.

## 17. Change Workflow

When changing design:

1. Update this document if the rule, token, or component contract changes.
2. Update runtime tokens if tokens change.
3. Update component/page CSS using token references.
4. Update relevant component tests or renderer tests.
5. Run typecheck, tests, and build before shipping.
